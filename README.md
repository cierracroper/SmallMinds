# SmallMinds
A small interactive website for children in grades K-3rd grade
This website was a group project from my senior year in undergrad where I was the lead developer for the site. 
To help improve upon my skills, this is a project I have decided to take on so I am in the process of planning a few updates to the the website and will house those changes/updates here to show my progress. 

I have uploaded the original powerpoint for this website also with this repository for more background information on the technologies used in this project. 


****You will need to have PHP installed on your machine for full functionality of the navbar. There are also  a few broken links that I am in the process of fixing along with the other changes I  have planned.
